# weather_node
Command line weather forecast built using Node, ES6, and APIXU free weather API

To use, run command "node weather.js" followed by a location name (ex: node weather.js Raleigh).

App gathers user input from command line, creates and fires off API call using this information to the APIXU weather API, and then parses response and builds out reply right in the console.
